This is a basic passenger counter app.

The purpose of this app is to count the passengers entering into a train of the subway, which makes it much more simpler for subway and train employees.

I used HTML, CSS and mostly Javascript to make it responsive and interactive.

I collaborated with the team at Scrimba while developing this project.
